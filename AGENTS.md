# AVDP Synthetic Dataset Framework — Agent Rules

**Detailed design:** `docs/spec.md` (schema), `docs/audio_generation_v3_design.md` (Implementation Tracker), `docs/implementation_plan.md` (milestones, risk register). Read these before any structural change.

## Repo layout

```

  script/           ← LLM script generation + Jinja2 templates
  tts/              ← TTS rendering (Azure/Google) + SceneMixer
  augment/          ← preprocessing, room IR, device profiles, noise
  labels/           ← auto-label generation, schema, IAA utilities

```

## Language / encoding

- All audio: **Hebrew (he-IL)**
- **Filenames:** strictly lowercase `[a-z0-9_-]`
- **JSON string fields validated by `ClipMetadata`:** no characters above U+00A1
- Hebrew text goes in `.j2` templates or `.txt` transcripts only
- `ClipMetadata` enforces the string-field rule via `@field_validator` on `clip_id`, `project`, `tts_engine`, `violence_typology`, `generator_version`

## Audio format (hard constraints)

- **16 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM WAV**
- **Peak limiter ceiling: −1.0 dBFS** — never scale up quiet clips (limiter, not normalizer)
- **Silence padding: ≥ 0.5 s** at head and tail — `silence_pad_applied_s` is per-side
- Onset/offset times from `MixedScene` must be shifted by the leading pad only
- **No torchaudio** — preprocessing uses `scipy` + `soundfile` exclusively
- **No lossy formats** (MP3, AAC) anywhere in the pipeline
- **Retain dirty files**: `preprocess()` writes them as `{output_path.stem}_dirty{input_suffix}` in `assets/` (CLI produces e.g. `{clip_id}_00_dirty.wav`); never overwrite

## Pipeline stages (keep modular, clean interfaces)

```
SceneConfig (YAML)
  → [1]  Script Generator      → DialogueTurns   (LLM + Jinja2)
  → [2]  TTS Renderer          → MixedScene WAV  (Azure/Google he-IL)
  → [3a] Preprocessing         → spec-compliant WAV
  → [3b] Acoustic Augmentation → augmented WAV   (Tier B and Tier C only)
  → [4a] Transcript Writer     → {clip_id}.txt
  → [4b] Strong Label Writer   → {clip_id}.jsonl
  → [4c] Metadata Writer       → {clip_id}.json
  → [5]  Validator             → validate_clip()
```

SFX onset/offset times come **only** from the Stage 3b augmentation log. Speech-turn times come from Stage 2 mixer output.

## Label taxonomy

- **Source of truth: `synthbanshee/data/taxonomy.yaml`** — never hardcode label strings in application code
- Three levels: `violence_typology` → `tier1_category` → `tier2_subtype`
- `has_violence` is a **derived convenience field**; the full taxonomy columns are ground truth
- `_TYPOLOGY_INTENSITY_MAP` in `cli.py` maps `(typology, intensity)` → `(tier1, tier2)`. If you add a typology to the taxonomy, add a row to the map — missing entries fall through to `("NONE", "NONE_AMBIENT")` silently
- Codes are validated against `taxonomy.yaml` at import; renaming a code causes an import `ValueError`

## TTS

- **Primary:** Azure `he-IL-AvriNeural` (M), `he-IL-HilaNeural` (F); SSML `<mstts:express-as>` + prosody tags
- **Secondary:** Google Cloud TTS Chirp 3 HD he-IL
- **Cache key: SHA-256 of the full rendered SSML string** — not `(voice_id, text)`
- **M3a — per-turn RMS gain:** `StyleEntry.rms_target_dbfs` → module-level `_apply_rms_gain()` in `synthbanshee/tts/mixer.py`; 4-tuple segment API `(wav_bytes, pause_s, speaker_id, rms_target_dbfs)`
- **Temp WAV from mixer must be `subtype="FLOAT"`** — never `PCM_16` before `preprocess()` to avoid hard-clipping M3 gain

## Splits

- **Speaker-disjoint**: never place the same speaker persona in more than one of train / val / test_synth

## Testing conventions

- Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) before integration tests (`tests/integration/`)
- Run: `pytest`; CI also runs `ruff` and `mypy` (Python 3.11 + 3.12)
- A clip is valid iff it passes `synthbanshee.package.validator.validate_clip(clip_path)`:
  1. All three files present (`.wav`, `.txt`, `.json`)
  2. WAV passes `validate_audio()` — 16 kHz, mono, peak ≤ −1.0 dBFS, duration ≥ 3 s
  3. JSON parses as `ClipMetadata` with `is_synthetic=True`
  4. Filename stem is ASCII-only lowercase

## Feature / milestone completion checklist

A feature or milestone is **not complete** until all of the following are true:

1. All code changes are committed and pushed to the feature branch.
2. A **non-draft** PR is open on GitHub targeting `main`, with:
   - A descriptive title following the `type(scope): subject` convention.
   - A body that includes: problem statement, solution summary, table of changes per file, and a test plan checklist with pass/fail results.
   - At least one label (e.g. `enhancement`, `bugfix`, `tests & testing`).
   - A milestone assigned (create one if none exists for this milestone ID).
3. The PR has been pushed — not just the branch.

Do not consider your work done after a commit. The PR is the deliverable.

## PR review workflow

When addressing PR review comments (Copilot, human, or bot):

1. Triage each open thread: resolve as already treated / implement fix / open issue + resolve as out-of-scope.
2. Land all code changes in a single commit on the feature branch and push.
3. **After the commit lands, resolve every addressed thread on GitHub** using the GraphQL API:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_..."}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
   ```
   Get thread node IDs with:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") { pullRequest(number: N) { reviewThreads(first: 50) { nodes { id isResolved comments(first: 1) { nodes { databaseId } } } } } } }'
   ```
4. Do **not** leave threads open after the corresponding change is committed — unresolved threads imply unfinished work.

## CI / Workflow conventions

- `pr-agent-context` is wired in two workflow files:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — initial CI run (produces the baseline context comment)
  - `.github/workflows/pr-agent-context-refresh.yml` — refresh run (review/check/schedule-driven)
- Both workflows call the reusable workflow via **`@v4` (floating major tag)** — do **not** pin to a specific patch version (e.g. `@v4.0.18`). The floating tag is intentional: it picks up compatible patch releases automatically, and the `tool_ref: v4` input mirrors it.
- Coverage artifacts are named `pr-agent-context-coverage-py<version>` (uploaded by the matrix `test` job). Both the CI `pr-agent-context` job and the refresh workflow reference them via `coverage_artifact_prefix: pr-agent-context-coverage` — do not change this prefix or the naming convention without updating both workflow files.
- The refresh workflow includes a `dispatch-scheduled-refreshes` job that runs every 15 minutes and fans out `workflow_dispatch` runs to open same-repo PRs that lack a current refresh comment. This is the fallback for bot-authored review events that do not fire a `pull_request_review` GitHub event.

## What NOT to do

- Don't mix speaker personas across train/val/test splits
- Don't hardcode Hebrew text in Python source
- Don't treat `has_violence` as the primary label — preserve the full taxonomy hierarchy
- Don't discard dirty pre-processing files
- Don't use lossy audio formats
- Don't generate clips shorter than 3.0 s
- Don't add a new typology to `taxonomy.yaml` without adding it to `_TYPOLOGY_INTENSITY_MAP`
- Don't pin `pr-agent-context` workflow references to a specific patch version — keep `@v4` floating
